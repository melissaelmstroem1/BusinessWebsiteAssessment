        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            ReDesign Jewellery was built on the idea that jewellery should evolve with you.
            Many women own sentimental pieces they no longer wear — whether outdated, damaged, 
            or simply not their style anymore. Our online service makes it easy to breathe new life 
            into those pieces without ever leaving your home.
        </p>
        <p>
            We combine modern digital tools with expert jewellery craftsmanship to create designs 
            that feel personal, meaningful, and truly unique.
